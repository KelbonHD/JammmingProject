## Description
Codecademy Spotify API Portfolio Project assigned to me to test my knowledge and capabilities with React.js
A simple spotify derived app designed to allow the user to create a custom playlist in a simple and quick way.
This is meant to be my first complex step into front-end development, so my app leaves much to be desired and I'm sure many users will find ways to break it, but as of now, if you use it as intended it works just fine.

## Features
-Requires you to log into spotify through the app.
-Search by song title.
-preview track's audio
-create and name your new playlist with up to 100 songs
-playlist is saved onto your spotify account

## Credits
Well I would say this app was made by me alone, but if you saw how many tabs I had open looking for resources and guides on how to do stuff, you'd also be hard pressed to say I did it alone! Thanks other people on the internet for having the same problems I was having.
